# HackIL26-CATrack

Sponsor Description  

Imagine if CAT Inspect and CAT AI Assistant joined forces to create something entirely new - a next-generation AI powerhouse for inspections. Picture the best features of both, seamlessly fused into a single, game-changing app. Unleash your creativity: leverage any AI technology at your disposal to build the ultimate solution that not only integrates these two tools, but redefines what’s possible in field operations. This is your chance to set a new standard think big, innovate boldly, and show us what the future of intelligent inspections looks like! In other words, if CAT Inspect & CAT AI Assistant have a baby!  

The Challenge  

Use generative AI to reimagine how machines are inspected, reduce manual effort and improve safety with AI-powered insights. 

Goal  

Build an AI-powered inspection experience that makes inspections safer, faster, and less costly by reducing on-site risk, and equipment/SME overhead, while improving documentation quality through multimodal AI and generating a clear, structured inspection summary aligned with inspection standards (Cat® Inspect standard reports). 

AI for Real-World Impact  

Teams should explore how AI can transform field inspection processes. Enable inspectors to use voice and image inputs to instantly create structured, actionable reports - eliminating manual paperwork and delays. Participants are encouraged to reimagine this workflow, using AI to turn unstructured data into high-quality insights that accelerate decision-making and improve documentation accuracy. The solution should help operators reduce errors, improve safety, and accelerate inspections or site operations. Think beyond traditional analytics: design an agent that reasons over rich multimodal inputs to deliver actionable insights and drive real-world efficiency at scale. 

 

Visual Parts Identification:  

Another challenge is to use AI for visual parts identification and fitment. The task is to create a solution where users can snap a photo or describe a part, and the system returns ranked part numbers with fitment certainty, tailored to specific equipment models. This addresses a major pain point in support and logistics, reducing errors and improving customer experience.  

  

Judging Criteria  

Projects will be evaluated on innovation & novelty, research, technical execution, impact, design, presentation, and the use of new AI interfaces and form factors. The challenge is not about perfect code or polished decks, but about creative, functional, process optimization and impactful use of AI to solve real-world problems. 

 

Mission  

Use your creativity to build an AI solution that pushes the boundaries of what’s possible in field operations and logistics. Show how AI can make inspections, parts identification be smarter, faster, and safer.
